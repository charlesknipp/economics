# Economics

A repository of all the code I use as an undergraduate economics/math student.

### The [pizza] eating problem

`pizza_py_eating_problem.py` spooked everyone in Dr. Prescott's class... clearly, except for me. The problem requires students to maximize aggregate utility over time by optimizing consumption; constraints include a discount rate, a time period, and a budget.

### The regression script

`regression.py` is an ongoing project that pulls from FRED data sets and regresses the joined data frames; it automatically accounts for heteroskedasticity and if there is only one regressor, it tells you to reject. You do need an api key from [FRED](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html) in order to run the script.

### The rest
