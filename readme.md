# Economics

A repository of all the code I use as an undergraduate economics/math student.

### The cake eating problem

`cake_is_a_problem.py` was introduced by Dr. Edward C Prescott in ECN 413. The problem requires
students to maximize aggregate utility over time by optimizing consumption; constraints include a
discount rate, a time period, and a budget.

### The regression script

`regression.py` is an ongoing project that pulls from FRED datasets and regresses the joined
dataframes; it automatically accounts for hederoskedasticity and if there is only one regressor, it
tells you to reject. You do need an api key from [FRED](https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html)
in order to run the script.

I will add more over time and if you are linked but not mentioned as a user, email me.
